# Description
Poison gtk theme + metacity. It's based on my other theme Akatsuki (http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Akatsuki+gtk?content=125837)

Equinox, murrine and aurora engines required (you probably have them if you use Ubuntu)

# How to Install
put Poison directory to ~/.themes for local user and /usr/share/themes for global user.
